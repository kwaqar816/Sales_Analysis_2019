# About Project
This is a raw data generated from sales company, Initially all the data were in 12 different CSV file.
First I combined all the data's into single CSV folder named all_data, using pandas [concat()](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.concat.html) 
Then the cleaning stuff begins, with cleaning of all Nan values missing values and so on.
